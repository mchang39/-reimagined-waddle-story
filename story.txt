Sherry, a character who does not know who her parents are, and was brought up New York adopted by a rich nice man called Bill

Bill was a rather eccentric man. He loved to decorate his house in bright colors and collect strange items from his travels.

Bill has a very beautiful wife and they have lived happily for the past twenty years. But one day, he cheated.

... Or at least they thought he was, since caught walking into the motel with another woman. It turned out that she was a blind lady meeting up with someone and Bill was simply helping her out, as her walking stick broke on her way there. Sherry found out about the whole story and sorted things out, and everyone lived happily ever after.
